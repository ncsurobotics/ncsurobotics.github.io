## Industry Partners Program
The Industry Partners Program (IPP) is a effort by AquaPack to facilitate connections between leading companies and our studentsâ€” students with real-world engineering experience.

### Student Benefits
- We host resume workshops to review and revise your resume to improve your chances of getting employed.
- Get one-on-one time with recruiters from great companies, allowing you the chance to make a truly memorable impression.
- Network with other students and professional recuiters, improving your chances of getting an employment opportunity now and in the future.

### Industry Partner Benefits
- We maintain a book with copies of the resumes of our members, which IPP partners gain access to.
- Our organization emphasizes industry readiness, so we use industry-standard tools and practices wherever possible. Our students are already trained and competent with software such as Solidworks and Git.
- Partner companies build relationships with a continually renewing talent pool of high quality students from a wide range of engineering diciplines, passionate about robotics and more.
