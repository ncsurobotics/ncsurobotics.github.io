  The latest iteration of our vehicle, SeaWolf VIII, was created with the goal of improving platform stability and consistency to enable future development work. This iteration drew from the lessons learned from previous iterations, and focuses on simplicity and maintainability throughout the design. SWVIII's systems are divided into <b>Mechanical</b>, <b>Electrical</b>, and <b>Software</b> subgroups.
