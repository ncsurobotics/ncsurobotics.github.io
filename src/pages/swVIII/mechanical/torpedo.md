title: Torpedo
---

SWVIII's Torpedo system enables it to accurately file two torpedoes through rings or at targets in order to acquire points. A ratcheting mechanism is used to retracts a spring before SWVIII is placed in the water. The spring is released by a lever arm connected to a waterproofed servo motor, allowing SeaWolf to autonomously fire the torpedoes at its desired target
