---

SeaWolf makes use of three waterproof hulls, A cut-to size main hull with custom tapped endcaps that contains all of SeaWolfs electrical systems, and two Blue Robotics battery hulls that provide power to SeaWolfs systems.

SeaWolfs Multi-Hull system allows for rapid replacement of spent batteries, and provides more room in the main hull for custom electronics systems.
