The dropper mechanism for SeaWolf VIII consists of three major components: a 5V electromagnet, a magnetic 440C stainless steel ball, and a 3D-printed housing. The electromagnet is seated in the upper portion of the housing and is snugly held in place with a screwed-on lid. The stainless steel ball, or marker, rests in the lower part of the housing. Current continuously runs through the electromagnet to create a magnetic field, which holds the marker secure in the housing.

When the time comes to drop the marker, the current is stopped and the marker is allowed to fall straight down out of the bottom of the housing. Two of these droppers attached to the bottom of SeaWolf VIII, enabling it to complete marker-related tasks.
