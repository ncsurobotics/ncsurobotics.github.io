SeaWolf's higher-level software is written in the Rust programming language. This code base interfaces with the control board, main electronics board, and peripheral devices to coordinate missions.

We use Rust because it offers:
- High performance comparable to C/C++
- A powerful type system and compiler capable of catching many errors at compile time
- Official tooling for building, testing, and documentation
- Modern language features
- Excellent documentation
