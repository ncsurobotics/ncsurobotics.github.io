title: Get to know us!

AquaPack Robotics is a student-run 501(c)(3) organization affiliated with [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). We were founded in 2004 and are always open to new members from any major; all we ask is that they are passionate about robotics.

Building a robot is an iterative and ever-evolving process. Currently, we are working on improving the current iteration of the SeaWolf platform: SeaWolf VIII and developing our upcoming robot SWIX. As we are always looking for ways to improve every little detail of our robots, each version of SeaWolf constitutes a complete rebuild of the platformâ€” SeaWolf IX will continue this trend, improving upon SWVIII's bulky size while maintaining it's modularity and robust system integration.

Outside of our robot, ourr organization works to improve each other's technical skills and spread our passion for robotics throughout the community. We often take our robot to various outreach events ranging from NC State Open Houses to one getting elementary school students involved in robotics at an early age.

Our annual goal is to successfully compete with SeaWolf in the [RoboSub](https://robosub.org/) robotics competition, an annual competition that will be held in Irvine, California in August, 2025.
