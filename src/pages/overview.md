AquaPack Robotics is a student-run 501(c)(3) organization affiliated with [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). We are always open to new members from any major; all we ask is that they are passionate about robotics.

Building a robot is an iterative and ever-evolving process. As such, we are working on improving the newest iteration of the SeaWolf platform: SeaWolf VIII. As we are always looking for ways to improve every little detail of our robots, each version of SeaWolf constitutes a complete rebuild of the platformâ€”SeaWolf IX, currently in the initial phases of research and development, will be no different.

Our organization also works outside of the classroom, not only to build a competitive robot, but also to improve each other's technical skills and spread a passion for robotics throughout the community. Often we will take our robot to various outreach events, such as one getting elementary school students involved in robotics at an early age.

Our ultimate goal, however, is to successfully compete with SeaWolf in [RoboSub](https://robosub.org/), an annual competition that in 2024 will be held in Irvine, California.
