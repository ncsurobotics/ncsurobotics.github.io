AquaPack headed to the Bull City, Durham, North Carolina, for the 11th Annual Bull City FIRST Lego League(FLL)Scrimmage at Trinity School. Jack Fetkovich, our electrical subteam lead; Ankitha Lavu, our business advisor; and I, Elizabeth Gillkin, our club president, were there to represent Aquapack. This seasons FLL game was "SUBMERGED," where the goal is to explore the ocean using creative thinking creative thinking and LEGOÂ® technology. 

A total of 24 teams attended, where the age range was roughly 9-14. Each team  presented on a research project, or solution that they had invented, that addressed a problem via underwater robotics (sounds similar to RoboSub...). Becuase of our familiarity with this concept, the three of us were better equipped to ask questions to the teams
