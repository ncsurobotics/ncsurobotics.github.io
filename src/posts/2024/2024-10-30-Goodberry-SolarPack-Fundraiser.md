AquaPack teamed up with SolarPack, NC State‚Äôs solar vehicle team, for a deliciously and fun fundraiser at Goodberry‚Äôs Frozen Custard. As two engineering-focused student organizations, it was a great opportunity to collaborate outside the lab and raise some much-needed funds for our teams.

The fundraiser took place on a Monday evening from 5 to 9 p.m., which was perfect timing, as it replaced our usual general meeting and gave members a chance to relax, connect, and support the club in a different setting. Thanks to a few generous upperclassmen who volunteered to drive, all participating members were able to get to the event without any problems (huge shoutout to our upperclassmen who make our lives easier üôå)!

For many of us, especially the newer members, this was the first social event of the semester, and it turned out to be the perfect icebreaker. The laid-back atmosphere at Goodberry‚Äôs made it easy to strike up conversations with people from other subteams we don‚Äôt always interact with during regular club meetings.

Even though we sacrificed some regular work time, the fundraiser ended up being a great bonding experience that strengthened our team dynamic. Events like this remind me AquaPack is more than building a robot, it's about building a community. 

Also, fun fact: Goodberry‚Äôs only has locations in North Carolina and Australia. Who knew frozen custard had such an exclusive range?

We‚Äôre already looking forward to hosting more fundraisers! What a sweet success (pun intended)! Go Pack! üê∫
