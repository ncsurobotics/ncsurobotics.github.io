AquaPack was excited to kick off the semester with a professional development event with on of our sponsors, Analog Devices Inc (ADI). The event focused on resume building in anticipation for the fall engineering career fair. We had four amazing speakers, Brian Holford, a hiring manager and a principal engineer, Sara Idris, a mixed signal test engineer, and two AquaPack Alumni (üôå) Amr Moussa, a software engineer, and Alex Pendergast, a layout designer.

Throughout the workshop, our guests offered resume tips, job application strategies, and even individualized feedback to students. The session saw over 50 attendees, including a strong showing from first-year students and non-AquaPack members exploring internship and co-op opportunities. This event was widely advertised around campus and was open to all majors and years. We're especially proud to have created a space that was both informative and accessible.

Huge thanks to our guests from ADI for their time, wisdom, and willingness to help us out. This is the kind of support AquaPack wants to be able to provide to NC State students along side our industry sponsors. We hope to see even more alumni and industry friends at future events!
