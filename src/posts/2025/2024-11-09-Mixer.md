Part of AquaPack's team, Elizabeth Gillkin, Jack Fetkovich, Jason Lu, Trevor Petzold, Cole Austin, and myself (the author of this blogpost of course, Sahiti Mudireddy) met with SolarPack's team at Morgan Street Food Hall. Elizabeth Gillkin, our club president, very kindly was able to set this up with the SolarPack's Project Director Fabiola F. Plascencia. This mixer was a great way to meet other clubs at NC State, and for myself, it was a great way to meet other upperclassmen.
