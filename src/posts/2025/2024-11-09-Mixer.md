Part of AquaPack's team, Elizabeth Gillkin, Jack Fetkovich, Jason Lu, Trevor Petzold, Cole Austin, and myself (the author of this blogpost of course, Sahiti Mudireddy) met with SolarPack's team at Morgan Street Food Hall. Elizabeth Gillkin, our club president, very kindly was able to set this up with the SolarPack's Project Director Fabiola F. Plascencia. This mixer was a great way to meet other clubs at NC State, and for myself, it was a great way to meet other upperclassmen.

One of the most interesting parts of the mixer was seeing how other ECE clubs on campus organize themselves. AquaPack is broken down into four main teams, electrical, mechanical, software, and business, and each team is broken down into smaller groups. However, SolarPacks subteams are Aerodynamics, High Voltage, Low Voltage, Structures, Vehicle Dynamics, and Business. These subteams seem to be less broad (seemingly, I'm not exactly certain how these subteams break up), and have significnatly cooler names ðŸ˜’. {% set alt = "Sam, a SolarPack freshman and Fabiola, solarPack project director." %}
