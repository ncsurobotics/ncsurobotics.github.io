Part of AquaPack's team, Elizabeth Gillkin, Jack Fetkovich, Jason Lu, Trevor Petzold, Cole Austin, and myself (the author of this blogpost, Sahiti Mudireddy) met with SolarPack's team at Morgan Street Food Hall. Elizabeth Gillkin, our club president, very kindly was able to set this up with the SolarPack's Project Director Fabiola F. Plascencia. This mixer was a great way to meet other clubs at NC State, and for myself, it was a great way to meet other upperclassmen.

One of the most interesting parts of the mixer was seeing how other ECE clubs on campus organize themselves. AquaPack is broken down into four main teams, electrical, mechanical, software, and business, and each team is broken down into smaller groups. However, SolarPacks subteams are less broad and break into Aerodynamics, High Voltage, Low Voltage, Structures, Vehicle Dynamics, and Business.

From a freshman's point of view, and as someone new to the club, it was exciting to spend time with club members and other NCState engineering students outside of a working space. I had a great time talking to other electrical and computer engineering students, Sam, a freshman on SolarPack, Jack, an upperclassman on AquaPack, and a couple other members on SolarPack. It was great to have insight into the courses and NCState and different perspectives on the industry. The night was a huge success, and a huge thank you to everyone who showed up. Go Pack! üê∫
