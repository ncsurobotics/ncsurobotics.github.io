# AquaPack Robotics
This is the AquaPack Robotics website, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) using the [Eleventy Excellent starter](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/) created by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/).
## Development
`npm` is required to build this project, so [install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if they are not already installed.
### Install Dependencies (Do this first)
```bash
npm install
```
### Previewing changes
The following command will watch for changes to the site as you edit and make a live preview available. You can view the preview in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8080 (by default).
```bash
npm start
```
> [!TIP]
> - The output will tell you if there are any errors, keep an eye on it while editing.
> - If you add any new image files, it is recommended to stop and rerun this command. 
### Production build
This minifies all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The result is in the `dist` directory.
```bash
npm run build
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A production build is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to Github, you should never need to do this.
### Generating favicons
This command will auto generate the favicons in `src/assets/images/favicon` using `src/assets/svg/misc/logo.svg`.
```bash
npm run favicons
```
### Generating colors
This command will regenerate the color palette based on the contents of `src/_data/designTokens/colorsBase.json`.
```bash
npm run colors
```
### Cleaning
Removes files generated by the build process:
- `dist`
- `src/_includes/css`
- `src/_includes/scripts`
```bash
npm run clean
```


Removes Open Graph preview images (src/assets/og-images)
```bash
npm run clean:og
```
