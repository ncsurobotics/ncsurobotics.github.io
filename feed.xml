				&lt;p&gt;Part of the AquaPack team; Elizabeth Gillkin, Jack Fetkovich, Jason Lu, Trevor Petzold, Cole Austin, and myself (the author of this blogpost, Sahiti Mudireddy) met with SolarPack‚Äôs team at Morgan Street Food Hall. Elizabeth Gillkin, our club president, very kindly was able to set this up with the SolarPack‚Äôs Project Director Fabiola Fabian Plascencia. This mixer was a great way to meet other clubs at NC State, and for myself, it was a great way to meet other upperclassmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_elizabeth_and_solarpack-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;1050&quot; alt=&quot;Elizabeth G. eating with members of SolarPack.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Elizabeth G. eating with members of SolarPack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting parts of the mixer was seeing how other engineering clubs on campus organize themselves. AquaPack is broken down into four main teams; electrical, mechanical, software, and business, and each team is broken down into smaller groups. However, SolarPacks subteams are less broad and break into Aerodynamics, High Voltage, Low Voltage, Structures, Vehicle Dynamics, and Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/mixer_sam_fabiola-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;1050&quot; alt=&quot;Sam, a SolarPack freshman and Fabiola, SolarPack project director.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sam, a SolarPack freshman and Fabiola, SolarPack project director.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a freshman‚Äôs point of view, and as someone new to the club, it was exciting to spend time with club members and other NC State engineering students outside of a working space. I had a great time talking to other electrical and computer engineering students, Sam, a freshman on SolarPack, Jack, an upperclassman on AquaPack, and a couple other members on SolarPack. It was great to have insight into the courses and NC State and different perspectives on the industry. The night was a huge success, and a huge thank you to everyone who showed up.

				&lt;p&gt;Last week, AquaPack headed to Durham, NC for the 11th Annual Bull City FIRST Lego League (FLL) Scrimmage at the Trinity School. The FLL game for the 2024-2025 was ‚ÄúSUBMERGED,‚Äù with the goal of exploring the ocean using creative thinking and LEGO¬Æ technology- as an organization that designs and builds autonomous underwater robots, this event was a perfect opportunity for AquaPack to step in and help out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 24 teams attended the scrimmage, with students ranging from 9-14 years old. Before bringing their bots to the field, each team presented on a research project that addressed an ocean-related problem via underwater robotics. Three of our team members volunteered as judges for this part of the day and were able to ask thought-provoking questions to each group of presenters as they displayed their hard-earned results and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll-comp-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;1050&quot; alt=&quot;Referees and students surround their tables and robots- The game is on!&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Referees and students surround their tables and robots- The game is on!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After team presentations, the hands-on competition began! Teams prepared LEGO¬Æ robots, that they had built and programmed, to go head-to-head on one of four playing fields as they worked their way up to determine the champion of the day. While the teams were busy competing, AquaPack was busy setting up a table to display our current competition robot, SeaWolf VIII, along with some of our most interesting subsystems and internal components. For the rest of the day, our AquaPack members were busy speaking to the teams that were waiting for their turn on the playing field (as well as some of their interested parents, siblings, and friends). Everyone asked great questions, and the enthusiasm of the students towards SeaWolf was unmatched. Our email was handed out to several teams who have since reached out to us for mentorship or research-related inquiries, and our volunteers on-site even gave advice to some very forward-looking students about college and life at NC State!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/fll_group-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;1234&quot; alt=&quot;AquaPack members Eric L., Jack F., Elizabeth G., and Ankitha L. tabling at the scrimmage&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AquaPack members Eric L., Jack F., Elizabeth G., and Ankitha L. tabling at the scrimmage&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, AquaPack coming out to the Bull City Scrimmage was a fantastic experience. It was invigorating to see the passion and dedication these FLL teams had towards their research, robots, and ideas for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;AquaPack teamed up with SolarPack, NC State‚Äôs solar vehicle team, for a deliciously and fun fundraiser at Goodberry‚Äôs Frozen Custard. As two engineering-focused student organizations, it was a great opportunity to collaborate outside the lab and raise some much-needed funds for our teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-960w.avif 960w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-960w.webp 960w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-960w.jpeg 960w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberry_poster-960w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1101&quot; alt=&quot;Poster advertising the fundraiser at Goodberry&#39;s&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Poster advertising the fundraiser at Goodberry&#39;s&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundraiser took place on a Monday evening from 5 to 9 p.m., which was perfect timing, as it replaced our usual general meeting and gave members a chance to relax, connect, and support the club in a different setting. Thanks to a few generous upperclassmen who volunteered to drive, all participating members were able to get to the event without any problems (huge shoutout to our upperclassmen who make our lives easier üôå)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of us, especially the newer members, this was the first social event of the semester, and it turned out to be the perfect icebreaker. The laid-back atmosphere at Goodberry‚Äôs made it easy to strike up conversations with people from other subteams we don‚Äôt always interact with during regular club meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/goodberrys_abhi_selfie-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;1050&quot; alt=&quot;Abhi P. taking a selfie with other Aquapack members eating custard.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Abhi P. taking a selfie with other Aquapack members eating custard.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we sacrificed some regular work time, the fundraiser ended up being a great bonding experience that strengthened our team dynamic. Events like this remind me AquaPack is more than building a robot, it‚Äôs about building a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, fun fact: Goodberry‚Äôs only has locations in North Carolina and Australia.

				&lt;p&gt;AquaPack was excited to kick off the semester with a professional development event with on of our sponsors, Analog Devices Inc (ADI). The event focused on resume building in anticipation for the fall engineering career fair. We had four amazing speakers, Brian Holford, a hiring manager and a principal engineer, Sara Idris, a mixed signal test engineer, and two AquaPack Alumni (üôå) Amr Moussa, a software engineer, and Alex Pendergast, a layout designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/ADI_alexis-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;932&quot; alt=&quot;AquaPack member, Aleixs M., talking to ADI hiring manager, Brian H.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AquaPack member, Aleixs M., talking to ADI hiring manager, Brian H.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the workshop, our guests offered resume tips, job application strategies, and even individualized feedback to students. The session saw over 50 attendees, including a strong showing from first-year students and non-AquaPack members exploring internship and co-op opportunities. This event was widely advertised around campus and was open to all majors and years.

				&lt;p&gt;At the end of July 2023 AquaPack Robotics represented NC State at the Robosub 2023 at NIWC TRANSDEC in San Diego California. Across 8 days the team worked on SW8, ran 5 days of competition testing, and completed 2 semi final runs. With the year of dedication and countless hours spent preparing for the competition, the AquaPack team is proud to announce we have placed 14th overall at RoboSub 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competition is broken up into several categories: design documentation, team video, website, design presentation, and best competition run. Taking the feedback the team received from judges at RoboSub 2022 the team prepared our Technical Design Report (TDR) and scored very well getting 146.1 points to achieve 6th place in this category. The technical presentation and team website scored 142.56 and 150.8 to achieve 24th place in these categories.The team‚Äôs fantastic introduction video, filmed with the help of NC State‚Äôs ECE department and Isabella Mormando, scored 101.27 points and achieved 10th place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition runs are split across 4 total phases. Each team is given the opportunity to qualify, 2 semi final runs, a third chance run, and a finals run. Qualification requires the demonstration of autonomy in which the robot must successfully navigate through a ‚Äúgate‚Äù completely autonomously. Semi-finals give teams the opportunity to complete various competition tasks, such a firing torpedoes, dropping markers, and tapping buoys. Each task scores a certain number of points. The best performing teams in terms of points are then allowed to compete in finals runs. Third chance allows any team that qualified for semi-finals to perform additional competition runs on finals day, with the aim of scoring enough points to qualify for a finals run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/sw8_robosub23-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;653&quot; alt=&quot;SeaWolf VIII in the water at NIWC Pacfic Transdec&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;SeaWolf VIII in the water at NIWC Pacfic Transdec&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-diverBrief-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;653&quot; alt=&quot;Alex Pendergast, Project Manager for 2022-2023, briefing divers on robot handling procedures and practice run goals&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Pendergast, Project Manager for 2022-2023, briefing divers on robot handling procedures and practice run goals&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;AquaPack completed runs in two semi-finals slots and attempted a third chance run. The team‚Äôs best scoring was for 1326 points during the second semi-final run. Post semi finals the team was in 13th for competition runs. After finals the team was bumped down to 14th place by Amador Valley High School, who scored highly in the third chance run after making necessary repairs to their robot both semi final days. AquaPack gladly supplied our teams‚Äô spare Blue Robotics ESCs to Amador Valley High, which allowed them to complete that points scoring run in the third chance and finish 5th overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest points scoring autonomous run of 1326 points completed on the second semi final day. Before the run began a total weight of SeaWolf VIII was taken, measuring 34.6 kg which scored 15 additional points for a weight bonus. The run consisted of SeaWolf VIII starting the run by passing through the gate while maintaining a fixed heading scoring 100 points plus an additional 150 points for fixed heading. The robot then made two complete 360 degree rotations in yaw to score 800 points for completing gate with style. The robot then completed a single tap of the buoy for the start dialing tap for 300 points. The final task attempted in the run was a dead reckoning towards and surface in the octagon for the Engaging Chevrons task. SeaWolf VIII ended up surfacing about 40 feet before the octagon and the team decided to lock in the successful run before the clock ran out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure slot=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-650w.avif 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-960w.avif 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-1400w.avif 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-650w.webp 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-960w.webp 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-1400w.webp 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-650w.jpeg 650w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-960w.jpeg 960w, https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-1400w.jpeg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ncsurobotics.github.io/assets/images/robosub2023-practicePool-1400w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;787&quot; alt=&quot;Taylor Randall, Mechanical Sub-Team Member, in the practice pool with SeaWolf VIII&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; eleventy:ignore&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Taylor Randall, Mechanical Sub-Team Member, in the practice pool with SeaWolf VIII&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;AquaPack is excited and hard at work prepping SeaWolf VIII for its next appearance at RoboSub 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the fall semester, the Mechanical team focused on designing our next fully autonomous robot, SeaWolf IX. The plan is to begin using SeaWolf IX for competition in 2025. Instead of using SolidWorks like previous years, the Mechanical team switched to Onshape for CAD modeling. The goal is to make SeaWolf IX AquaPack‚Äôs best scoring robot to date with capabilities of completing all RoboSub competition tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software team transferred the code used at RoboSub 2023 from Java to Rust. At the last pool test of the fall semester, SeaWolf VIII was capable of moving through the gate fully using Rust. Last year‚Äôs leadership as well as this year‚Äôs leadership believes that this transition to Rust will significantly improve SeaWolf VIII‚Äôs performance in the RoboSub 2024 competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical team refined the electrical system for SeaWolf VIII to be competition ready before focusing on the design and creation of SeaWolf IX‚Äôs electrical board. With collaboration from the mechanical sub-team, the electrical sub-team has decided to use a single hull for all of SeaWolf IX‚Äôs electrical components unlike SeaWolf VIII, which has two separate battery hulls from the hull containing the electrical board.&lt;/p&gt;
