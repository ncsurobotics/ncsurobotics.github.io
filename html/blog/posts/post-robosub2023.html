                <p>
                    At the end of July 2023 AquaPack Robotics represented NC
                    State at the Robosub 2023 at NIWC TRANSDEC in San Diego
                    California. Across 8 days the team worked on SW8, ran 5 days
                    of competition testing, and completed 2 semi final runs.
                    With the year of dedication and countless hours spent
                    preparing for the competition, the AquaPack team is proud to
                    announce we have placed 14th overall at RoboSub 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The competition is broken up into several categories: design
                    documentation, team video, website, design presentation, and
                    best competition run. Taking the feedback the team received
                    from judges at RoboSub 2022 the team prepared our Technical
                    Design Report (TDR) and scored very well getting 146.1
                    points to achieve 6th place in this category. The technical
                    presentation and team website scored 142.56 and 150.8 to
                    achieve 24th place in these categories.The team’s fantastic
                    introduction video, filmed with the help of NC State’s ECE
                    department and Isabella Mormando, scored 101.27 points and
                    achieved 10th place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Competition runs are split across 4 total phases. Each team
                    is given the opportunity to qualify, 2 semi final runs, a
                    third chance run, and a finals run. Qualification requires
                    the demonstration of autonomy in which the robot must
                    successfully navigate through a “gate” completely
                    autonomously. Semi-finals give teams the opportunity to
                    complete various competition tasks, such a firing torpedoes,
                    dropping markers, and tapping buoys. Each task scores a
                    certain number of points. The best performing teams in terms
                    of points are then allowed to compete in finals runs. Third
                    chance allows any team that qualified for semi-finals to
                    perform additional competition runs on finals day, with the
                    aim of scoring enough points to qualify for a finals run.

                    AquaPack completed runs in two semi-finals slots and
                    attempted a third chance run. The team’s best scoring was
                    for 1326 points during the second semi-final run. Post semi
                    finals the team was in 13th for competition runs. After
                    finals the team was bumped down to 14th place by Amador
                    Valley High School, who scored highly in the third chance
                    run after making necessary repairs to their robot both semi
                    final days. AquaPack gladly supplied our teams’ spare Blue
                    Robotics ESCs to Amador Valley High, which allowed them to
                    complete that points scoring run in the third chance and
                    finish 5th overall.

                    The highest points scoring autonomous run of 1326 points
                    completed on the second semi final day. Before the run began
                    a total weight of SeaWolf VIII was taken, measuring 34.6 kg
                    which scored 15 additional points for a weight bonus. The
                    run consisted of SeaWolf VIII starting the run by passing
                    through the gate while maintaining a fixed heading scoring
                    100 points plus an additional 150 points for fixed heading.
                    The robot then made two complete 360 degree rotations in yaw
                    to score 800 points for completing gate with style. The
                    robot then completed a single tap of the buoy for the start
                    dialing tap for 300 points. The final task attempted in the
                    run was a dead reckoning towards and surface in the octagon
                    for the Engaging Chevrons task. SeaWolf VIII ended up
                    surfacing about 40 feet before the octagon and the team
                    decided to lock in the successful run before the clock ran
                    out.

                    During the fall semester, the Mechanical team focused on
                    designing our next fully autonomous robot, SeaWolf IX. The
                    plan is to begin using SeaWolf IX for competition in 2025.
                    Instead of using SolidWorks like previous years, the
                    Mechanical team switched to Onshape for CAD modeling. The
                    goal is to make SeaWolf IX AquaPack’s best scoring robot to
                    date with capabilities of completing all RoboSub competition
                    tasks.

                    Software team transferred the code used at RoboSub 2023 from
                    Java to Rust. At the last pool test of the fall semester,
                    SeaWolf VIII was capable of moving through the gate fully
                    using Rust. Last year’s leadership as well as this year’s
                    leadership believes that this transition to Rust will
                    significantly improve SeaWolf VIII’s performance in the
                    RoboSub 2024 competition.

                    Electrical team refined the electrical system for SeaWolf
                    VIII to be competition ready before focusing on the design
                    and creation of SeaWolf IX’s electrical board. With
                    collaboration from the mechanical sub-team, the electrical
                    sub-team has decided to use a single hull for all of SeaWolf
                    IX’s electrical components unlike SeaWolf VIII, which has
                    two separate battery hulls from the hull containing the
                    electrical board.
